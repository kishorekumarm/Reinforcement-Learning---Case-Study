# Reinforcement Learning

* Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning, and thereby also a branch of Artificial Intelligence. 
* It allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behaviour within a specific context, in order to maximize its performance. 
* Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn its behaviour; this is known as the reinforcement signal.
